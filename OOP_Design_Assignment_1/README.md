#### Single Responsibility Principle (***SRP***)    


__Single Responsibility Principle__ states that every module or class should have the responsibility over a single part of 
the responsibility provided by the software/application, and that the responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by class, 
module or function.

The image below shows the UML diagram of the OOD structure of the Employee. I have implemented the structure in Java (Note that connecting to the database is not priority so I only used System.out.println to print out the connection status.)
